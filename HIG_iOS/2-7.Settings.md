# Settings

Some apps may need to provide a way to make setup or configuration choices, but most apps can avoid or delay doing so. Successful apps work well for most people right away, while also offering some convenient ways to adjust the experience. When you design your app to function the way most people expect, you decrease the need for settings.

**Infer what you can from the system.** If you need information about the user, device, or environment, query the system for it whenever possible instead of asking the user. For example, instead of asking someone to enter their zip code so you can present local options, ask permission to use their current location. Gracefully fall back to manual entry if the user denies access to their information.

**Thoughtfully prioritize configuration options within your app.** Your app’s main screen is a good place for options that are essential or that change frequently. Secondary screens are better for options that change only occasionally.

**Expose infrequently changed configuration options in Settings.** The Settings app is a central location for making configuration changes throughout the system, but people must leave your app to get there. It’s far more convenient to adjust settings directly within your app. If you must provide settings that rarely require change, see Implementing an iOS Settings Bundle in Preferences and Settings Programming Guide for developer guidance.

**Provide shortcuts to Settings when appropriate.** If your app includes text that directs users to Settings, such as “Go to Settings > MyApp > Privacy > Location Services,” provide a button that opens that location automatically. For developer guidance, see openSettingsURLString in UIApplication.
