# Adaptivity and Layout

People generally want to be able to use their favorite apps on all of their devices and in any context. To meet this expectation, design an adaptable interface by configuring UI elements and layouts to automatically change shape and size on different devices, during multitasking on iPad, in split view, when the screen rotates, and more.

## Device Screen Sizes and Orientations
iOS devices have a variety of screen sizes and people can use them in either portrait or landscape orientation. In edge-to-edge devices like iPhone X and iPad Pro, the display has rounded corners that closely match the device’s overall dimensions. Other devices — such as iPhone SE and iPad Air — have a rectangular display.

If your app runs on a specific device, make sure it runs on every screen size for that device. In other words, an iPhone-only app must run on every iPhone screen size and an iPad-only app must run on every iPad screen size.

## Auto Layout

Auto Layout is a development tool for constructing adaptive interfaces. Using Auto Layout, you can define rules (known as constraints) that govern the content in your app. For example, you can constrain a button so it’s always horizontally centered and positioned eight points below an image, regardless of the available screen space.

<p align="center"><img src= "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/images/adaptivity-and-layout/ov-full-screen_2x.png" width= "40%"></p>

Auto Layout automatically readjusts layouts according to the constraints you specify for certain environmental variations, known as traits. You can set your app to dynamically adapt to a wide range of traits, including:

* Different device screen sizes, resolutions, and color gamuts (sRGB/P3)

* Different device orientations (portrait/landscape)

* Split view

* Multitasking modes on iPad

* Dynamic Type text-size changes

* Internationalization features that are enabled based on locale (left-to-right/right-to-left layout direction, date/time/number formatting, font variation, text length)

* System feature availability (3D Touch)

For developer guidance, see NSLayoutConstraint and UITraitCollection.

## Layout Guides and Safe Areas

A layout guide defines a rectangular region that helps you position, align, and space your content on the screen. The system includes predefined layout guides that make it easy to apply standard margins around content and restrict the width of text for optimal readability. You can also define custom layout guides.

A safe area defines the area within a view that isn’t covered by a navigation bar, tab bar, toolbar, or other views a view controller might provide.

iOS 15 and later defines a keyboard layout guide that represents the space the keyboard currently occupies and accounts for safe area insets. Using this guide can help you make the keyboard feel like an integral part of your app, regardless of the type of keyboard people use or where they position it. For developer guidance, see UIKeyboardLayoutGuide.

<align="right"><img src= "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/images/adaptivity-and-layout/keyboard-layout-guide-keyboard-dismissed_2x.png" width="30%"></align=>

**Adhere to the system-defined safe areas and layout margins.** These layout guides ensure appropriate insetting based on the device and context. The safe area also prevents content from underlapping the status bar, navigation bar, toolbar, and tab bar. Standard system-provided views automatically adopt a safe area layout guide.

For developer guidance, see Positioning Content Relative to the Safe Area and Positioning Content Within Layout Margins.
